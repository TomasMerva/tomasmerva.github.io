    I enjoy implementing robotics algorithms, with a primary focus on motion planning and real-world deployment on hardware.
    Currently working as a <span class="role">Robotics Software Engineer</span> in the autonomous drone domain,
    I began my career in industrial automation and embedded systems.
    Over the past years, I transitioned into robotics, completing a PhD on motion planning for static and mobile manipulators.
